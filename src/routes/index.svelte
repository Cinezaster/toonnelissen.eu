<h2>Who's Toon</h2>

<p>I'm a being of the <strong>human</strong> species, interested in to many things. I like to create, make, organise, discover, explore and coordinate. </p>
<p>I earn my living as the manager of <a href="https://appsaloon.be">AppSaloon</a>, a software development company I co-founded in 2011. </p>
<p>I'm advocating openness and transparency as a boardmember of Open Knowledge Belgium and as a co-organiser of Civic Lab Brussels. Project lead of Influencair the civic owned air quality sensor network.  </p>
<p>I get lost in researching/understanding the way things/ the world works and making. </p>
<p>I find peace in music, dance and mountains</p>
